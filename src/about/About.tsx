      <p>Hej! Henlo fren!</p>
      <p>
        I am just a dude trying to take life one step at a time, unperturbed and
        unbothered.
      </p>
      <p>
        I grew up in the greater Seattle area and went to the University of
        Washington to study CompE/CSE for a combined BS/MS degree. I was a
        teaching assistant for the majority of my time at university and I
        really liked interacting with people and watching them learn things.
      </p>
      <p>
        I like to spend time learning and thinking about things. I get lost in
        thought sometimes (maybe even most of the time). I'm not always the best
        in social situations; but if that's the case, know that I don't have
        anything against anyone. I'm just really, really awkward and I'm not
        used to social settings.
      </p>
      <p>
        I like computer science, tech, and math, but I make no claims to how
        much I actually know or understand. I'm proud to say that it is likely a
        non-negative amount. (With high probability!)
      </p>
      <p>
        I like volunteering. I'm currently a volunteer teacher with TEALS to
        teach Computer Science to high school students. I also like volunteering
        for random events when I can find the time or learn about them!
      </p>
      <p>
        Professionally, I'm a staff software engineer üë®‚Äçüíª, which means that I am
        a professional keyboard and mouse clickity-clacker. I generally work
        remotely, but I'm based in the greater Seattle area and collaborate with
        people across the country (to try) to get things done.
      </p>
      <p>
        Being a software engineer means that I write code (read: bugs), yeet the
        code into the cloud, and fix things that inevitably crash prod(uction).
        Being a senior software engineer just means that I've taken down prod a
        handful of times and I work with people to try to take down prod less
        frequently.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've worked at large companies and start-ups and I have a preference for
        start-up environments.
      </p>
      <p>Things I try to do:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I try to leave things in a better place than when I found it</li>
        <li>I try to build what I need, not what I want</li>
        <li>I try to say no biggie and actually mean it</li>
        <li>I try to remain unbothered üôèüßò</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Besides tech, I'm interested in things like accessibility because
        everyone deserves to have a seat at the table. I like public
        transportation because everyone deserves to be able to go places. I like
        sustainability because everyone deserves to live in a world for
        generations to come.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other than that, in my free time, I'm usually at the gym, playing games,
        grabbing food with friends, going to concerts, or watching shows.
      </p>
      <p>Things I want to do this year:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Go to the gym more consistently</li>
        <li>Cook more</li>
        <li>Get better at a language</li>
        <li>Volunteer more</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Welp, that's pretty much me.</p>
