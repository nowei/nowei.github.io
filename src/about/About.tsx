      <p>
        I'm a se√±or software engineer at a startup in Seattle. Being a software
        engineer just means that I go clickity-clack on my keyboard to move bits
        in the cloud.
      </p>
      <p>
        I spend a lot of time thinking about things and how we get to where we
        are.
      </p>
      <p>I like to volunteer in my free time.</p>
    </div>
