      <p>Henlo fren!</p>
      <p>
        I am just a dude trying to take life one step at a time, unperturbed and
        unbothered.
      </p>
      <p>
        I grew up in the greater Seattle area and went to the University of
        Washington to study CompE/CSE for a combined BS/MS degree. I was a
        teaching assistant for the majority of my time at university and I
        really liked interacting with and seeing the moment people understood
        something.
      </p>
      <p>
        I like to spend time learning and thinking about things. I get lost in
        thought sometimes. I'm not always the best in social situations, but if
        that's the case, know that I don't have anything against anyone, I'm
        just really, really awkward and I'm not used to social settings.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a nerd ü§ì that likes computer science, tech, and math, but I make no
        claims with respect to how much I actually know or understand. I'm proud
        to say that it is likely a non-negative amount. (With high probability!)
      </p>
      <p>
        I also like volunteering. I'm currently a volunteer teacher with TEALS
        to teach Computer Science to high school students. I like volunteering
        for random events when I can find the time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Professionally, I'm a se√±or software engineer üë®‚Äçüíª, which means that I am
        a professional keyboard and mouse clickity-clacker. I generally work
        remotely, but I'm based in the greater Seattle area and collaborate with
        people across the country to try to get things done.
      </p>
      <p>
        Being a software engineer means that I write code (read: bugs), yeet the
        code into the cloud, and fix it when it inevitably crashes prod. Being a
        senior software engineer just means that I've taken down prod a handful
        of times and I work with people to try to take down prod less
        frequently.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've worked at large companies and start-ups and I have a preference for
        start-up environments.
      </p>
      <p>Things I try to do:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I try to leave things in a better place than when I found it.</li>
        <li>I try to say no biggie and actually mean it.</li>
        <li>I try to remain unbothered.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Besides tech, I'm interested in things like accessibility because
        everyone deserves to have a voice. I like public transportation because
        everyone deserves to be able to go places. I like sustainability because
        everyone deserves to live in a world for generations to come.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time, I'm usually playing games, grabbing food with friends,
        going to concerts, or watching shows.
      </p>
      <p>Things I want to do this year:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Go to the gym more consistently</li>
        <li>Cook more</li>
        <li>Get better at a language</li>
        <li>Volunteer more</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Welp, that's pretty much me.</p>
