With the industrial revolution and investment in new forms of production, the
bourgeoisie owned the means of production and made money in the name of free
trade, getting rid of competition by pushing them out of their spaces. They
remake the instruments of production so that they can stay relevant, not letting
the means of production settle is part of how they maintain their power. They
push their products and ideals everywhere with cheap products. There is so much
means of production that people can free themselves, but the bourgeoisie expand
to new markets and further exploit workers and attempt to destroy the ways in
which people can free themselves. The proletariat is the working class that can
only live as long as they work, a commodity, and are subject to market forces.
Extensive machinery/automation leads to the devaluation of the work that people
do, reducing their worth to the cost it requires for them to live. As these get
more efficient and there is more specialization/division of labor, the toil also
increases on the worker, for they are producing more, processing more, or
working more hours. As some tasks become easier to do, differences matter less
as everyone becomes an instrument of labor. The lower middle class, e.g.
tradespeople, shop-keepers, and peasants, are included in the proletariat
because they can't compete with the new methods of production. Workers at
different companies in the same space are pit against each other or there is
coordination to attack those that stand in the way of the bourgeoisie. The
founding of unions is the banding of workers in the face of prevarious
situations. Increased access to communication technology has allowed for workers
who face isolated local struggles to band together. The bourgeoisie also see
competition among themselves, seeking help from the proletariat in the form of
advocacy. Sometimes some members of the ruling class switches sides having
understood the history of the struggle. The proletariat survives while other
classes die out. The lower-middle class, small businesses, fight against the
bourgeoisie to continue to exist, and try to maintain the status quo, i.e. are
conservative, or even go back to a time when they were more relevant. When their
position is threatened with falling into the proletariat class, only then are
they revolutionary in a way that benefits the proletariat. Then there are also
sellouts who sell out the party or the movement for bribes. Any member of the
class that is more well-off than another member is incentivized to maintain the
status quo because it is in that setting in which they obtained wealth, so Marx
claims that the proletariat cannot move on unless they break all forms of
appropriation. He calls all previous historial movements movements of
minorities, while the proletarian movement is the movement of majority for the
benefit of the majority. Systems of oppression are maintained through pathways
in which the oppressed can become members of society, or maybe even oppressors
themselves. The bourgeoisie don't know everything. If the modern worker's living
conditions worsen over time, is it the worker's fault? Is it right to have the
bourgeoisie they work under maintain their rule over the workers as their living
conditions suffer? Industry advances as workers band together and unite. Modern
industry is unsustainable because it takes advantage of the workers without
giving workers a way to sustain themselves when the bourgeoisie fight it out
against each other. In the face of growing competition among the bourgeoisie,
they are incentivized to cut corners and squeeze out as much production from
their workforce so they can undercut competition. C2 The goal of communism isn't
to abolish property rights, but to abolish bourgeoisie property. Capital is the
product of united action of many members. Minimum wage is the minimum amount of
money necessary to barely sustain a worker. Communism isn't about abolishing the
minimum wage, but to get rid of the idea that people are only allowed to live as
long as the ruling class (those with capital) deems it so. He claims that in a
bourgeoisie society, people live to work and in a Communist society, people work
to make the lives of other people easier. In capitalism, capital is independent
and can be spent freely/independently, while the worker is dependent on the
capital and has less individuality. Freedom in capitalism refers to free trade
and free selling and buying. Communism posits that doing away with private
property is fine because the majority of people cannot afford property anyways,
e.g. they rent. Then doing away with private property also does away with the
bourgeois culture in that their culture is associated with ownership of
property/production. There is also a claim that the idea of family doesn't exist
among the proletariat, as they are essentially all working or away from each
other. People's thoughts change if their settings and experiences change. The
prerequisites to revolutionize society already exist within society. Communism
wants to do away with religion/morality and constitute them on a new basis. I'm
not too sure what they mean about this, since I can see religion as helpful at
times, although I must concede that religion has been cause for class
antagonisms throughout history. It seems like it acknowledges that the early
phases of implementing communism will be essentially be seen as tyrannical,
since it just swoops up property in the name of the state. It also assumes a
general class consciousness and that members involved in leading the politcal
party of proletariats have the common good of man in mind rather than the desire
to amass power.
