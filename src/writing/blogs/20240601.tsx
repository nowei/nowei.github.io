      <h2>It's 10:56 PM.</h2>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm tired, or maybe I think I am. It's kind of
        weird. I wake up, go to the gym, work, eat, and then sleep. I
        occasionally visit friends, but many of them live in Seattle and I'm
        waiting for the light rail station in Lynnwood to open up. Even then,
        it's still faster to drive in many cases, but at least there would be
        options.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it hard to travel far and go places, but
        at the same time I don't want to stay inside all day and rot away,
        grinding away at work on one project to the next. It's hard to find a
        good balance because the entire idea of the 9-to-5 is that you are
        working with maybe an hour of lunch in between and that you're available
        to talk to or monitoring things in case something breaks. But the 9-to-5
        was started in the 1920s and we just kept it alive for all this time. We
        are arguably the most productive we have ever been in human history, but
        we hold onto the antiquated idea of working those hours because we've
        done so in the past. Maybe my problem is that I'm self-aware of the
        rotting. Maybe my problem is that when I do something, I'm either bored
        and get tired, or I hyperfixate on finishing something?
      </p>
      <p>
        How did the generations before us do it? Maybe they had brighter
        futures? Did they have a better sense of duty to the work that they do?
        To the company they spend their limited time on earth? Maybe it's the
        social security? Maybe inflation wasn't as bad back then? Maybe they
        could own buy a house and raise a family? Maybe life was not as bleak?
      </p>
      <p>
        I think I'm okay at what I do, or at least that's what people tell me.
        Maybe I'm complaining too much, but is the intensity of the suffering I
        feel overexaggerated? But it is how I feel and is it wrong of me to feel
        that way?

        But maybe that's just life. It feels like I'm cycling between feeling
        alright and feeling general angst about life. Oftentimes I feel like I
        rely too much on my family, like living at home or them cooking for me.
        The only real contribution I make is to the bills and the occasional
        grocery run. Who knows?
