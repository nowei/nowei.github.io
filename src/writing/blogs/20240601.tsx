      <h1>6/1/2024: Cycle times</h1>
      <hr />
      <h2>It's 10:56 PM.</h2>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm tired, or maybe I just think I am. It's kind
        of weird. I wake up, go to the gym, work, eat, and then sleep. I
        occasionally visit friends, but many of them live in Seattle and I'm
        waiting for the light rail station in Lynnwood to open up. Even then,
        it's still faster to drive in many cases, but at least there would be
        more options. Or they live in Bellevue and I need to find the motivation
        to drive down there.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find it hard to travel far and go places, but
        I should probably just bite the bullet and go. I don't want to stay
        inside all day and rot away, grinding away at work on one project to the
        next. It's hard to find a good balance during the work week because the
        entire idea of the 9-to-5 is that you are working with maybe 30 minutes
        to an hour of lunch in between. Then the rest of the time you're
        supposed to be working, be available to talk, join meetings, or monitor
        things in case something breaks. But the 9-to-5 was started in the 1920s
        and we just kept it alive for all this time. We are arguably the most
        productive we have ever been in human history, but we hold onto the
        antiquated idea of working those hours because that's what we did in the
        past. Maybe my problem is that I'm aware of the rotting. When I do
        things, I cycle through hyperfixating on things, then getting tired,
        then bored? Then I get burnt out if I work too much and question why I'm
        doing anything or if I should just close up shop and go on a journey of
        self-discovery.
      </p>
      <p>
        How did the generations before us do it? Maybe they had brighter
        futures, higher hopes? Did they have a higher sense of duty to the work
        that they do? To the company they spend their limited time on earth
        grinding away for? To the family that they're working to support? Maybe
        it's reinforcement of societal norms, the fact that previous generations
        had it worse, therefore we should be grateful for what we have and how
        we have it? Maybe inflation wasn't as bad back then? Maybe they could
        own and buy a house and raise a family? Maybe life was not as bleak?
      </p>
      <p>
        Where did the collective shine in our eyes go? The purpose that we are
        all searching for. Does it actually exist or is it something we made up
        to cope with the heavy, crushing reality we find ourselves living in
        (struggling through)?
      </p>
      <p>
        I think I'm okay at what I do, or at least that's what people tell me.
        Maybe I'm complaining too much, but is the intensity of the suffering I
        feel overexaggerated? I know that I am in a privileged situation in that
        I can work from home and make money, but this is how I feel and is it
        wrong of me to feel that way? I guess everyone's perspectives are
        different and they experience life at their own pace?

        Maybe that's just how life is. It feels like I'm cycling between feeling
        alright, that I'm making progress in the life that I live, and feeling
        general angst; like I'm not doing enough or not where I should be. I
        might be burnt out, maybe from work, or maybe the monotony of the life
        that I live. I think there's something wrong with me, but I could also
        be imagining problems that don't exist. Although to deny one's
        perception of the world is also a sort of oppression.
        {/* Oftentimes I feel like I rely too much on my */}
        {/* family, like living at home or them cooking for me. The only real */}
        {/* contributions I make are to the bills and the occasional grocery run. */}
      </p>
      <p>
        When people look at your life from the outside, how would they perceive
        it? Not that it should matter, but what would they think? What would
        they think about the way that you live your life? Your schedule, your
        diet, your habits, your quirks, what you stand for and believe in. While
        it is incredibly reductive; you are, in part, what you do. This misses
        out on the dreams and aspirations that people have, but what strides are
        you making towards achieving your goals? If you want to learn a new
        language, what are you doing to make that happen? Although, in many
        cases, it is usually only those that are privileged enough to be able to
        choose what they do. There is usually some level of effort involved; but
        to be able to choose what you can do, to be the master of your own
        destiny, is not a privilege that most people have.
      </p>
      <p>
        I guess what I want to say is that if you're trying to be the best
        version of yourself, what are you doing to get there? How do you get
        from point A to B and not fall into an endless cycle of dread, boredom,
        and despair? What are we doing with our lives such that we are improving
        and making strides towards what we want to do and where we want to be?
      </p>
      <p>
        I think there's something wrong with me. I get overwhelmed. I find it
        hard to start things because if I start something, I would like to
        finish it, otherwise I feel like I failed somehow. This is a negative
        attitude that should probably be addressed, since in the marathon of
        life, taking the first step is crucial to getting anything done. You
        might not know how to do something, but you start to learn by taking the
        plunge, the first step, or whatever distance metaphor people use
        nowadays. We convince ourselves that it is difficult to do, so we don't
        even start. We tell ourselves that the limited time we have is better
        spent one way or another. Or that we're just waiting for X or Y before
        starting something. This is likely why things like new years resolutions
        often fail. We predicate starting on an arbitrary milestone that will
        just pass, like any other day of the year. We tell ourselves that it
        will be different this time around, that we're cracked the code on how
        our brains tick. That this time, we will succeed in what we set out to
        do countless times before.
      </p>
      <p>
        But maybe we should just do it. We might fail. Actually, in all
        likelihood, we will probably fail, but maybe that's just part of the
        journey. Human resilience is to try, against whatever odds, however
        great the probability of failure is. We will not get anything done by
        sitting around and twiddling our thumbs, waiting for the new year or
        some vacation or break to do something. We kind of just have to take
        life by the horns and go for it. It's easy to say that we can't do
        something when we haven't even tried. It's harder to say that we can't
        do something after actually trying, since problems at that point are
        identifiable and addressable. Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
      </p>
      <p>
        Successful people have failed in the past, they have pivoted ideas, they
        have uprooted their sense of how the world works. Failing is a part of
        the process. Maybe you give up after a day. Maybe you do it after a
        month? Who we are as a person generally isn't defined by a single day,
        but by the life we have lived. With our limited time, every day matters.
      </p>
      <p>
        In any case, I might be burnt out. I might be depressed. I might have
        crippling social anxiety and I probably have neurodivergent tendencies.
        I don't think I'm normal. I mean, in this day and age, who is? Maybe my
        frame of reference is messed up. Everyone considers themselves normal
        until they learn that they aren't. If it makes sense to you, it might
        not make sense to other people, at least not in the same way it does to
        you. It's kind of hard to put it into words. A word for not being able
        to be described is indescribable, but this isn't exactly that. Since
        while it is hard to define, it is not impossible to define.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe this is just the life that I live. In the universe of possible
        outcomes, maybe there is nothing wrong with me. But then why does it
        feel like there's something wrong with me? It's not my goal in life to
        stand out and be different, but I don't think I'm crazy.

        I always wondered why people rewatch TV Shows, since there's more
        content available than any one person can consume in their lifetime. Why
        would they go back and watch something that they've already seen? From
        what I understand, people did it because those shows are familiar and
        could act as some sort of baseline they could return to whenever they
        wanted to, where they knew exactly what was going to happen and remind
        them of the good times that they had when they first watched it. Perhaps
        it even provided them some solace and stability in the turbulent world
        that we live in.
      </p>
      <p>
        But I also play games, which in a sense is somewhat similar, we might
        return to the games that we do because there's a sense of comfort or
        security in it. Or you can play with friends and unwind and focus your
        mind on something else for a few hours. I also started playing Hades and
        then eventually Hades 2 and realized that it's kind of similar, the fact
        that we play the same game over and over again is similar to watching a
        show over and over again. It might not be the best use of time, but it
        feels comfortable because you know exatly what will happen.

        I started going to the gym more since November, but then I learned a few
        things about working out. If the goal is to build muscle, then it's more
        effective to work out to failure every time than trying to get more
        reps. But if the goal is to build endurance, then you should try to do
        more reps to failure.
