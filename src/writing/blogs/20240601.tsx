      <h2>It's 10:56 PM.</h2>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm tired, or maybe I just think I am. It's kind
        of weird. I wake up, go to the gym, work, eat, and then sleep. I
        occasionally visit friends, but many of them live in Seattle and I'm
        waiting for the light rail station in Lynnwood to open up. Even then,
        it's still faster to drive in many cases, but at least there would be
        more options. Or they live in Bellevue and I need to find the motivation
        to drive down there. Or they live in other parts of the country, or they
        live in other countries.
      </p>
      <p>
        I find it hard to travel far and go places, but I should probably just
        bite the bullet and go. I don't want to stay inside all day and rot
        away, grinding away at work on one project to the next. It's hard to
        find a good balance during the work week because the entire idea of the
        9-to-5 is that you are working with maybe 30 minutes to an hour of lunch
        in between. Then the rest of the time you're supposed to be working, be
        available to talk, join meetings, or monitor things in case something
        breaks. But the 9-to-5 was started in the 1920s and we just kept it
        alive for all this time. We are arguably the most productive we have
        ever been in human history, but we hold onto the antiquated idea of
        working those hours because that's what we did in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think part of my problem is that I can just sit there and continue
        working, like there's always a way to make progress on something, so I
        can just keep going. There's always something to fix or something to
        improve. Another part of the problem is that I'm aware of the rotting.
        When I do things, I cycle through hyperfixating on things, then getting
        tired, then bored? Then I get burnt out if I work too much and question
        why I'm doing anything. At that point, I consider if I should just close
        up shop and go on a journey of self-discovery. Although I almost never
        do, or when I do, it is only to the extent that questions get asked
        about my relationship with work.
      </p>
      <p>
        How did the generations before us do it? Maybe they had brighter
        futures, higher hopes? Did they have a higher sense of duty to the work
        that they do? To the company they spend their limited time on earth
        grinding away for? To the family that they're working to support? Maybe
        it's the reinforcement of societal norms. Or it could be the idea that
        previous generations had it worse, therefore we should be grateful for
        what we have and how we have it? Maybe inflation wasn't as bad back
        then? Maybe they could own and buy a house and raise a family? Maybe
        life was not as bleak?

        <h2>Where did the collective shine in our eyes go?</h2>
      </center>
      <p>
        Where is the purpose that we are all searching for? Does it actually
        exist or is it something we made up to cope with the heavy, crushing
        reality we find ourselves living in (read: struggling through)? I know
        that I am pessimistic by nature, but this is not purely a personal
        struggle. This is not purely an American struggle, even. Young people
        everywhere feel unprecedented hopelessness. I don't think it's that they
        lack purpose, but that they lack the ability to see themselves in the
        future being happy and content with their lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think I'm okay at what I do, or at least that's what people tell me.
        Although I think I'm starting to let it get to my head and it's making
        me more rash, dismissive, and overconfident in how I'm doing things. I
        might be complaining too much, but is the intensity of the suffering I
        feel overexaggerated? I know that I am in a privileged situation in that
        I can work from home and make money, but this is how I feel and is it
        wrong of me to feel that way? I guess everyone's perspectives are
        different and they experience life at their own pace. I think I'm in my
        own head too often.

        Maybe that's just how life is. It feels like I'm cycling between feeling
        alright, that I'm making progress in the life that I live, and feeling
        general angst; like I'm not doing enough or not where I should be. I
        might be burnt out, maybe from work, or maybe the monotony of the life
        that I live. I think there's something wrong with me, but I could also
        be imagining problems that don't exist. Although to deny one's own
        perception of the world is also a sort of oppression of the self.

        When people look at your life from the outside, how would they perceive
        it? Not that it should matter, but what would they think? What would
        they think about the way that you live your life? Your schedule, your
        diet, your habits, your quirks, what you stand for and believe in. In
        reality, it doesn't matter what other people think of you and what
        actually matters is what you think of yourself. While it is incredibly
        reductive; you are, in part, what you do. This overlooks the dreams and
        aspirations that people have, but what strides are you making towards
        achieving your goals? If you want to learn a new language, what are you
        doing to make that happen? Although, in many cases, it is usually only
        those that are privileged enough to be able to choose what they do.
        There is usually some level of effort involved; but to be able to choose
        what you can do, to be the master of your own destiny, is not a
        privilege that most people have or can afford.

        I guess what I want to say is that if you're trying to be the best
        version of yourself, what are you doing to get there? How do you get
        from point A to B and not fall into an endless cycle of dread, boredom,
        inactivity, and despair? What are we doing with our lives such that we
        are improving and making strides towards what we want to do and where we
        want to be?

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there's something wrong with me. I get
        overwhelmed. I find it hard to start things because if I start
        something, I would like to finish it, otherwise I feel like I failed
        somehow. Like I lost something, or that I'm a loser. This is a negative
        attitude that should probably be addressed, since in the marathon of
        life, taking the first step is crucial to getting anything done. You
        might not know how to do something, but you can start to learn by taking
        the plunge, the first step, or whatever distance metaphor people
        generally use for starting something. Sometimes we convince ourselves
        that it is difficult to do, so we don't even start. Other times, we tell
        ourselves that it is easy to do, only to learn that we have grossly
        underestimated the scope of whatever we're trying to achieve. We tell
        ourselves that the limited time we have is better spent one way or
        another.
      </p>
      <center>
        <h2>
          Or that we're just waiting for X or Y before starting something.
          Surely, it was the lack of X or Y that prevented us from achieving
          something in the past. After X or Y, we will have more time, more
          energy, more gusto.
        </h2>
      </center>
      <p>
        This is likely why things like new years resolutions often fail. We
        predicate starting on an arbitrary milestone that will just pass, like
        any other day of the year. We tell ourselves that it will be different
        this time around, that we're cracked the code on how our brains tick.
        That this time, we will succeed in what we have failed to do countless
        times before.
      </p>
      <p>
        We should just do it; bite that bullet, pull that trigger, let it rip.
        We might fail. Actually, in all likelihood, we will probably fail, but
        maybe that's just part of the journey. To be resilient is to try and try
        again against whatever odds, however great the probability of failure
        is. Whatever badness the outcome of failure carries with it. We will not
        get anything done by sitting around and twiddling our thumbs, waiting
        for the new year or some vacation or break to do something. We kind of
        just have to take life by the reins and enjoy the ride. It's easy to say
        that we can't do something when we haven't even tried. It's harder to
        say that we can't do something after actually trying, since problems at
        that point are generally identifiable and addressable. Nothing ventured,
        nothing gained.
      </p>
      <p>
        Successful people have failed in the past, they have pivoted ideas, they
        have uprooted their sense of how the world works. They constantly
        question themselves and their reality to make it make sense. Sometimes
        this works, other times people may fall into a trap and believe
        themselves to be right(eous). They consider the world, then they accept
        their own interpretation of reality, in a sort of grand and convoluted
        circumvention of reality (I daresay, rejection of reality but we will
        revist this at a different time...).
      </p>
      <p>
        Failing is a part of the process. Maybe you give up after a day. Maybe
        you do it after a month? The day or month you put in and stopped still
        brings you that much closer to whatever you want to do. Maybe it's
        messy, unprincipled, raw, unfettered? Who cares? It can still be
        considered progress.

        <h2>
          Who we are as a person generally isn't defined by a single day, but by
          the life we have lived. With our limited time, every day matters and
          any progress is infinitely better than no progress. To take a step is
          generally much better than standing still.

        In any case, I might be burnt out. I might be depressed. I might have
        crippling social anxiety and I very likely have neurodivergent
        tendencies. I don't think I'm normal. I mean, in this day and age, who
        is? Maybe my frame of reference is messed up. Everyone considers
        themselves normal until they learn that they aren't. If it makes sense
        to you, it might not make sense to the vast majority of people, at least
        not in the same way it does to you. We kind of just go on with our lives
        in a way assuming that people think the same way as we do and we become
        shocked when we learn that this isn't the case. It's kind of hard to put
        it into words. A word for not being able to be described is
        indescribable, but this isn't exactly that. Since while it is hard to
        describe, it is not impossible to describe.
      </p>
      <p> I guess it's just a feeling I have.</p>
      <p>
        Maybe this is just the life that I live. In the universe of possible
        outcomes, maybe there is nothing wrong with me. But then why does it
        feel like there is? It's not my goal in life to stand out and be
        different and I don't think I'm crazy. Maybe I'm just aware of the
        differences. In life, a lot of things won't matter to anyone else but
        you. I guess what I'm trying to say is that people may be
        self-conscious, but they should know that they generally pay more
        attention to themselves than anyone else would pay attention to them. So
        if you get embarassed, just know that it'll stick with you for a long
        time, but in the universal consciousness, it is just a blip in its
        infinite awareness. And Time goes on.

        Surviving is difficult, thriving is nearly impossible. Some people may
        argue that this just isn't true, but everyone has their own set of
        standards. What is okay to someone might be great to someone else. I
        think it's important to respect how other people judge things or assign
        value. Since you can usually learn something from the decisions and
        reasoning or you learn more about how the person sees the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Personally, I think most things are okay. Generally okay means okay with
        slight +/- deviations and I usually respond with that when people ask me
        how I'm doing. Although what I have been told is that it's usually
        better to respond with "good", which is weird to me because at some
        point good becomes normal unless something exceptional happens? It's
        also kind of fake to always say that everything is good. Like we have
        different things going on in our lives and not everything will always be
        good or great.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think people have mentioned before that having a positive leaning
        helps you feel more happy. Or that you just perceive life in a brighter,
        lighter way. I'm not sure how true this is because it seems like it's
        just cope. Although I have also heard that smiling more makes you more
        happy. Maybe in a way we've kind of just Pavlov'ed ourselves into
        thinking that. We smile when we are happy, so by smiling maybe we'd be a
        little happier.
      </p>
      <p>
        What may be a small inconvenience may color the rest of your day with a
        negative tint. I think what's important is to let go and being able to
        start again. Like the day is not ruined because you accidentally dropped
        your keys or something didn't go your way. I think I have a problem with
        this as well, since I linger, I ruminate, I ponder on the things that
        happen in my life. How the events could have played out differently, how
        it could've been better. Instead of doing that, I should probably go out
        of my way to make it better. How do we make it better? Try to make it
        more meaningful. Be a more meaningful, principled person; think through
        your actions and have a plan. It's important to reflect, but do not
        linger for longer than you have to.

        Maybe that's just it. The key to living a happy life is to learn to let
        go and moving on, generally unbothered. Well, maybe it's not the key,
        but an important part of being happy. There is no silver bullet to
        happiness. We kind of just have to live our lives to the fullest in the
        short time we have on this earth with the people we have in our lives.

        I always wondered why people rewatch TV Shows, since there's more
        content available than any one person can consume in their lifetime. Why
        would they go back and watch something that they've already seen? From
        what I understand, people did it because those shows are familiar and
        could act as some sort of baseline they could return to whenever they
        wanted to, where they knew exactly what was going to happen and remind
        them of the good times that they had when they first watched it. Perhaps
        it even provided them some solace and stability in the turbulent world
        that we live in.

      <p>
        But I also play games, which in a sense is somewhat similar, we might
        return to the games that we do because there's a sense of comfort or
        security in it. Or you can play with friends and unwind and focus your
        mind on something else for a few hours. I also started playing Hades and
        then eventually Hades 2 and realized that it's kind of similar, the fact
        that we play the same game over and over again is similar to watching a
        show over and over again. It might not be the best use of time, but it
        feels comfortable because you know exatly what will happen.

        I started going to the gym more since November, but then I learned a few
        things about working out. If the goal is to build muscle, then it's more
        effective to work out to failure every time than trying to get more
        reps. But if the goal is to build endurance, then you should try to do
        more reps to failure.
