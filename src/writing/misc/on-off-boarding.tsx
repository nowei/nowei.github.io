        I don't on-board or off-board often, but here's a list of action items
        you should do when you're off-boarding and on-boarding.
      </Text>

      <Title>Off-boarding</Title>
      <List>
        <List.Item>
          <b>Talking to people</b>: this is very important because you want to
          stay on good terms with people you've worked with. You should take the
          initiative to schedule these meetings instead of waiting for people to
          schedule them for you. Thank the people you've worked with and learned
          things from. People I would recommend talking to:
          <List>
            <List.Item>Managers</List.Item>
            <List.Item>Skips</List.Item>
            <List.Item>Co-workers you've worked with/like</List.Item>
          </List>
        </List.Item>
        <List.Item>
          <b>Give a notice</b>: two weeks is standard. Unless the work
          relationships are strained, try to give them time so that you can
          facilitate knowledge transfer so the people staying behind are more
          prepared to take over everything you've been working on.
        </List.Item>
        <List.Item>
          <b>Insurance and benefits</b>
          <List>
            <List.Item>
              Your benefits may end before your new job begins; so try to
              schedule covered events well in advance if you know that things
              will change.
            </List.Item>
            <List.Item>
              If you have (company) credits that you can use for something that
              you (remotely) want or your friends may want; consider spending
              them since they'll just go to waste once you leave.
            </List.Item>
          </List>
        </List.Item>
        <List.Item>
          <b>Rolling over your 401k</b>: make sure you have access to the
          accounts or roll it over to your new company's new 401k company so you
          don't need to keep track of <Code>n</Code> many different financial
          platforms - be wary of overcontributing to the 401k if you switch
          mid-year.
        </List.Item>
        <List.Item>
          <b>Company stock</b> - make sure you have access to the accounts or
          roll it over to the same financial account
          <List>
            <List.Item>
              for RSUs (e.g. start-ups), determine if you want to buy it within
              3 months of leaving(90 days)
            </List.Item>
          </List>

            <List.Item>
              Payslips/Tax information like W2's (generally for at least 7
              years)
            </List.Item>
          </List>
        </List.Item>
        <List.Item>
          Take some time to write down what you've accomplished on the job, for
          future reference (or to look back on the times)
        </List.Item>
        <List.Item>
          Tie up any loose ends, write down any notes helpful for transition.
          Write down what you know.
        </List.Item>
        <List.Item>
          Return your gear, you might need to mail it in or get it wiped by IT.

        <List.Item>Log out of your work accounts on your phone.</List.Item>
        <List.Item>Exit paperwork</List.Item>
        <List.Item>
          <b>Do an exit interview!</b> You can leave candid feedback, but it
          depends on HR if they want to action any of it. Apparently you might
          also need to sign a slip of paper confirming that you didn't break the
          NDA + a non-solicitation clause.
        </List.Item>
        <List.Item>Say goodbye</List.Item>
        <List.Item>
          Figure out how to get home because maybe you depended on some
          work-sponsored transit card.

          want to do before/after work
        </List.Item>
        <List.Item>
          Get your gear, we mainly only care about the laptop and access to

              If your team doesn't have an on-boarding document, create it while
              you're setting your environment. This could include (personal)
              recommendations, repos to pull, important things to know
              about/pointers to parts of the codebase/architecture, etc.
            </List.Item>
            <List.Item>
              If the team is new/busy, there might not be an on-boarding
              document yet, so starting one would be good to help anyone that
              joins after you! (Assuming that the team is healthy/the team's
              positioning in the company is stable, the team will grow over
              time...)
            </List.Item>
            <List.Item>
              Generally, you'll want to set up VSCode, test that you can access
              your company's version control system (e.g. add an ssh key to your
              github account), make sure you can log into company accounts.

            Bring up process improvements you can see; every place does things

          Use the first few months to ramp up so that you can learn how to
