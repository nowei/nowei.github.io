  <h2>Goodbyes are weird</h2>
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I graduated from undergrad in spring 2019 and as I was sitting there in the stadium where
    the graduation was held, a thought came up. Everyone is going off to do great and amazing things, with their whole 
    lives ahead of them. But the question that stuck in mind was, will I ever see any of these people again?

    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We get exposed to a lot of people in college and after college, everyone goes kind of goes
    their separate ways.
