    <h1>Things I learned as a Software Engineer</h1>

    <p style="text-align: center">
      I've been working for a while. Stuff I learned as a Software Engineer (at
      a Startup)
    </p>

    <h3>Year 2</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>People like people who help others and jump on things fast</li>
      <li>How do you work sustainably? Questionable</li>
      <li>
        To get good at asking questions, ask a lot of questions to figure out
        what are good questions and what are bad questions
      </li>
      <li>
        Do I even like what I'm working on? It's hard to say, it seems like
        necessary work (although arguably a lot of work in some views may be
        seen as unncessary)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Advice from Peter (v good, best senior)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        "For things with no answers, try to develop muscles w/o necessarily
        knowing what the right answer is"
      </li>
      <li>
        "Don't spend too much time fixing bugs, start with the best solution you
        can think of at the moment and ask for feedback. Come up with something
        defensible and if it's too bad, people will say something. Be able to
        evaluate ideas without running everything down all the way. Increase
        scope and context, narrow down on details when necessary."
      </li>
      <li>Seek out fun problems</li>
      <li>
        What is the day-to-day? what do you enjoy? Are you happy with what you
        do and the things you work on? Sometimes analyzing whether you enjoyed
        this so far doesn't work because things can change, sometimes you have
        to take a chance.
      </li>
      <li>
        How can you pursue the things that bring you joy? Sometimes you don't
        always know what the right choice is and many things aren't reversible.
        Most of the time you can't be 100% sure about whether something is the
        right choice, so you kind of just need to convince yourself that it's
        the right choice. Many things can become unknown and if stuff changes,
        you kind of just have to handle it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make MRs to at least start the discussion. Maybe there's a better way to
        do something?
      </li>
      <li>
        The only good thing high-level docs are for is discussion of API and
        should not be overtly designed around implementation constraints. What
        is the essence of what you're trying to do? Bad APIs are ambigous, try
        to make it less ambiguous and break down the problem into multiple
        steps, tasks.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Year 1</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Testing is important, but don't bend over backwards to get 100% code
        coverage if the codebase isn't set up in a way that is easily testable
      </li>
      <li>
        If code isn't easily testable, maybe things can be improved so that
        things are more self-contained/testable? Can the parts be mocked out to
        test the different code paths?
      </li>
      <li>
        If broken things bug you or other people, attempt to fix things even
        though it's not your fault that something is broken. Prioritize work to
        prevent work for others.
      </li>
      <li>
        Determine what your priorities are. Sometimes some tickets are more
        important than others, especially if something unblocks another person.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make an effort to remember things that people say, otherwise it's rude
        if people have to keep bringing something up, since it seems like you
        weren't listening or something. You can write things down, but make an
        effort to keep what they said in mind. "If you want to forget something,
        write it down."
      </li>
      <li>
        Stand up for yourself on the work that you're doing - figure out what
        the highest-value contribution you can be making is and work towards
        that.
      </li>
      <li>
        Take some time to plan out what you're going to do the next day/next
        week
      </li>
      <li>
        Don't get stuck on naming things, but give it a little bit of thought
        and feel free to let others suggest things
      </li>
      <li>Check back in with people who ask for help</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Misc, in-between notes</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center">
      I've learned a lot and there's still more things to learn and more things
      I need to improve on, but I guess that's life. Everyone is in a constant
      struggle in the cycle of self-improvement. To be better than they were the
      day before... But when does it end? Does it ever end? There is likely no
      limit, no peak for us to aim for, only a vague sense of direction. Maybe
      some people are content with where they are in life and they decide to
      stop? Who knows?

    <h2>Stuff I learned as a Data Engineer Intern at Microsoft</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Break down a problem as much as possible so that you can track work that
        is unstarted, is in progress, is blocked, or is done
      </li>
      <li>
        Try to avoid manual processes since human time is almost always more
        valuable than the time it takes to automate things
      </li>
      <li>Try to understand limitations to frameworks and technology</li>
      <li>
        Try to work around limitations or find alternatives when technologies
        are prohibitive, don't just throw your hands up and be like, "It's not
        my fault/problem"
      </li>
      <li>
        Emails are good documents, but kind of slow in terms of coordinating and
        communication
      </li>
      <li>
        It takes time to understand things, not everyone needs to know all the
        details, try to figure out what people need to know before communicating
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Stuff I learned as a Software Development Engineer Intern at Amazon</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Timebox things, figure out how much time things take, manage
        expectations
      </li>
      <li>
        It's better to get more things done than being stuck on a problem for a
        long time
      </li>
      <li>
        It might be a good idea to try to do multiple things at at time so that
        you can still make progress while being stuck and waiting for people to
        respond
      </li>
      <li>
        Even if people tell you that you're doing okay or well or are on-track,
        maybe determine that for yourself. They may be trying to make you feel
        better, but in reality you need to step up? Kind of an odd message o_o
      </li>
      <li>
        If you're stuck on something, ask for help; sometimes it's also good to
        just confirm with others, just to make sure that you're on the right
        track
      </li>
      <li>
        Spend time reading over code at the beginning of new jobs, ask questions
        about it -- No one expects you to know everything at the beginning. So
        the quicker you start on something, the expectation is that you
        understand enough of the system to make changes and updates. Take the
        time to get yourself set up and oriented.
      </li>
      <li>
        Have some confidence, but don't be full of yourself; there's a fine line
        between arrogance and confidence
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Stuff I learned as a Software Engineering Intern in Taiwan</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Language barriers are hard, it's good to know multiple languages (not
        talking about programming languages)
      </li>
      <li>
        When done with a task, communicate with key stakeholders before going
        off and doing other things
      </li>
      <li>Remember things</li>
      <li>
        If you don't know anything, that's okay. No one knows anything at the
        beginning.
      </li>
