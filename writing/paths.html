  <h2>Goodbyes are weird</h2>
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I graduated from undergrad in spring 2019 and as I was sitting there in the stadium where
    the graduation was held, a thought came up. Everyone is going off to do great and amazing things, with their whole 
    lives ahead of them. But the question that stuck in mind was, will I ever see any of these people again? 
  </p>
  <h2>Life and goals as a computer science problem</h2>
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We get exposed to a lot of people in college and after college, everyone goes kind of goes
    their separate ways. I mean, eventually, you do as well. Everyone eventually finds their own path in life. There may be 
    some roadblocks, but that's okay. We all got to where we are; so we'll all get to where we'll eventually be. This 
    kind of hit me recently: the choices I make, the decisions to do or not do something, impact my future. I guess there's
    an endless number of paths we can take and we all have a model of the world in our mind, so we sort of have an idea of 
    what we're doing with our lives in terms of the actions we take. 
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I guess you can say that there was a path of actions that lead you from some point in time into another and it's sort of 
    like Laplace's Demon, but without the same level of determinism/absolutism and generality: If you know the outcome of 
    actions, you can choose some series of actions that eventually brings you to the desired outcome. In other words, you know 
    that some action or policy will lead you to some reward with some probability. Then you have the choice of deciding 
    to take that action or not and you'll sort of have an idea of where you'll end up, with some probability. This is only with
    some probability because our model of the world isn't perfect, so we need to account for errors in our understanding or 
    chance.
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    I guess you can also sort of see this as a path-finding problem. If you have a goal, there might be multiple paths 
    to get to where you want to go, but some paths may be longer than other paths and it might not be optimal. I guess we choose
    our paths unconsciously, but we're all on a path and I guess the question is what action do you want to take on the path 
    you're currently on given that you have some vague idea of where you need to go. I guess at any point in time, you have an
    infinite number of possible actions you can take, but some are more likely than others. This might be a little too much to
    think about at any given time; but each of these actions leads you to another state in the path, which may be closer or
    further away from whatever goal you have. 
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    There really isn't a point to this, but I guess you can model your goals as a boundless path-finding problem. Although,
    I guess the point in me learning computer science is to apply it to my life somehow, either using it or being able to 
    view things in life through the lens of programming, which might be important as we try to make more life-like AI. 
    Life is essentially performing actions and expecting/observing responses, which is basic I/O; so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
  </p>
  <h2>People leave and that's okay</h2>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Anyways, let's get back on the topic of people going their separate ways. We go about our lives meeting new people, hanging
    with old people, and I guess do things by ourselves. This sounds like all the cases, so we go forward. There may be times 
    in our lives when the people we know have similar goals or interests and the paths of your life can be considered to be 
    connected or parallel to theirs and you'll both try to accomplish some goal and maybe you'll support each other in your
    endeavors. Who knows. Anyways, eventually the goals diverge or circumstances change and people will go their separate 
    ways, whether you like it or not. 
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Then, when people go off into the great big world, what do you do? It's kind of interesting because every
    time you see someone, it might be the last time that you see them. This begs the questions: Are you satisfied with
    how you lived your life? Did you do everything you wanted to do? Have you said everything you wanted to say? What does
    it mean to live a life with no regrets? 
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    We go about our lives with this knowledge. I mean, everyone knows this, but do we truly recognize it before 
    something happens and realize that we've taken this knowledge for granted? We look to the past with a sense of 
    nostalgia and comfort, especially when compared to the present. Then again, we all suffer some regret, even if 
    we don't recognize it at the moment. Sometimes regret can only be realized when looking back at the past. 
  </p>
  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    Maybe there's some grand conclusion that someone can reach from this, but this is all I have to say about this at the moment.
