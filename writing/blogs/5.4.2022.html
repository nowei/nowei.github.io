    <h1>5/4/2022: As good a time as any</h1>
    <hr />
    <h2>It's 10:36 PM.</h2>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I still believe reflection is good and I can't
      exactly say it's hard to find the time. I think it's harder to find the
      motivation after working the entire day. I'm 8 months into my first job
      outside of college and the stuff I work on is somewhat interesting. I get
      the feeling that there's so much I still need to learn and an inkling of
      imposter syndrome, but maybe that feeling never goes away. Maybe the
      universe of things to know is infinite and everything we learn is a drop
      in an infinite bucket. The only meaningful comparison then only exists
      between what we know now and what we knew in the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the spirit of recording the general feeling of
      my days at this point in time, I sit in front of a computer from around 9
      to around 5, give or take some time depending on projects. Then give or
      take some more time depending on how many times I remember to get up over
      the work day. It's not physically demanding. Or maybe it is in the sense
      that humans of the past were active and this runs counter to what our
      ancestors have done. In which case, it is physically demanding in that it
      isn't physically demanding. After work, I spend what time I have with
      friends and family. Playing games, getting food, watching shows, going on
      walks, and going to random events. Maybe this is what life will be like
      until the end? Is this the kind of future I imagined? Is this what I want
      to do for the rest of my life? It's not a bad life and it's not a bad job.
      Maybe I'm looking for meaning in the wrong place. In the end, it's a job,
      it pays the bills, I'm learning new things, but time flies by faster than
      I would like to admit. Or maybe I mentally block out the time it takes for
      Rust to compile and that's where the time goes.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Looking back on my time in college. I do have some
      regrets. I wish I spent more time interacting with and meeting people. The
      last two years were a bit rougher in that aspect, with the pandemic and
      all. I think the best times I've had back in college was when I was
      working on things with people and when I was TAing. I think one thing I
      could've improved on was being more respectful of time, my own as well as
      others'. I had office hours pretty frequently, helped other TAs, and held
      extra office hours. At UW, TAs usually had to hold at least one hour or so
      of office hours a week and probably teach a section or two. This was the
      expectation and it was met most of the time, but it sometimes felt like
      there was an unequal amount of effort that was put in among TAs. My office
      hours were scheduled for one hour but would often end up spanning multiple
      hours and on occasion extend past midnight. It's crazy how some students
      stayed up during those times to attend. I know that if students didn't get
      help at the exact moment they encountered issues, it wasn't the end of the
      world. Everyone was smart, capable of learning, and accomplishing things
      that they set their mind to and I trusted these students to figure things
      out and ask questions when they're stuck. It was probably on me to as the
      person in the position of authority to set these boundaries, but I felt
      like these were unprecedented times and that people should get as much
      help and support as they need.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I TA'ed several professional masters classes and
      most of the other TAs had office hours during the day, which is when
      people were working or had meetings, so the only office hours that really
      worked were the ones after normal working hours, which were only held by a
      few TAs. I was pretty impressed by these students. Like after working
      their full-time job during the day, they still pushed themselves to
      continue learning and working on things like homework and going to classes
      at night. This is like having two jobs. Many people had families as well,
      which to me is kind of crazy and commendable. I guess the same thing goes
      for people who work while going to school, have multiple jobs, or like
      volunteer after work.
    </p>
    <img src="./imgs/5.4.2022/moon-1.jpg" style="width: 50%; height: auto" />
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TAing came at a cost though. This often cut into
      time for my own work, especially work on group projects and research,
      which during the masters portion of my time at UW was generally open-ended
      and exploratory. This led me to have the mindset of speedrunning work to
      try to stay on top of things, which for personal development reasons is
      detrimental. I am grateful to all my friends who helped me out during this
      time. I was in school for a bit more than 17 years of my life. School and
      CS are not personality traits. I need to develop myself more. as a person.
      I need to cook more, learn more, and try new things to go out of my
      comfort zone. I'm not sure how people would describe me. I hope
      positively, but each person is different so it's somewhat reasonable to
      believe that each person's perception of you will be different. Maybe the
      way I talk is too safe? With uninvested language like somewhat, probably
      and okay. Maybe this can be attributed to a desire for safety? Maybe I
      don't like being wrong; but being wrong, not being good at things, and
      failing are a part of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's kind of wild though. Like the number of
      people you can meet when you go to college. It's hard to meet people
      outside of work nowadays. I actually have to put in effort to go out and
      do things to meet new people. Anyways, in college there's occasionally the
      big-brained person you meet and you kind of just wonder how things work in
      their world. Like their thought process and how they interpret problems
      and ideas. Is it experience? Good intuition? A mix of both? Some people
      say that it just makes sense to them or that conclusions are direct. It's
      like reading a paper and the proof says something like, "The conclusion
      directly follows." But it doesn't seem like it directly follows for you
      and you spend like two hours staring at a proof trying to rederive the
      conclusion and it feels more like "the proof is left as an exercise for
      the reader" rather than "the conclusion directly follows". They don't know
      everything and they will openly admit that they don't know some things,
      but that doesn't stop them from trying to understand them. Most seem to be
      optimistic about problems. Maybe some even view it as a challenge to
      overcome. Like a boss in a video game and the video game is life. I think
      these are the types of people who end up becoming professors and
      researchers. They likely don't consider themselves to be big-brained.
      Maybe we're all big-brained but in different ways and we just don't
      recognize it. Or maybe everyone just has imposter syndrome. I fervently
      believe that you don't need to be big-brained in order to know things or
      to be successful. Although being big-brained doesn't hurt, but maybe
      becoming big-brain doesn't happen overnight and it's something that's
      developed over time, forged in the flames of interesting challenges and
      quenched in the waters of curiosity. I aspire to be big-brain in one
      aspect or another one day, but how that might happen is kind of blurry.
    </p>

    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm out of school now. Working feels like there's
      more free time after work, but I think work takes more time than school.
      There's no homework and people generally don't need to work on weekends
      (depending on company), but the time invested from 9 to 5 every day for
      five days a week for ~52 weeks a year give or take some vacation takes
      more time than school. We don't get summers off and doing internships
      during the summer was probably a taste of that. Having money is nice,
      especially since I grew up essentially without an allowance. Making money
      starting in college and after is nice because that meant I could hang out
      with friends, go get food, and go to concerts. But at what cost? There's
      increased responsibility and there's a certain finality to all of it.
      There are consequences in the real world. Failing a class or test isn't
      the end of the world in college, but missing a deadline or burning out may
      have significant impacts at work. Or maybe it's the same as college, since
      immediate issues we think are a big deal don't really seem like big issues
      after some time passes. Like the perceived severity of issues is an
      exponential moving average and only the more recent points stand out more,
      but in the grand scheme of things, problems don't really matter in the
      long run. Now that I'm working, I have more time to try to build solid
      foundations and good habits to try to navigate through early adulthood,
      but like many things in life, it's still a work in progress. Maybe one
      without end, except for the End. If we stop improving, stop learning,
      maybe that's the end for us anyways?

    <h2>Time passes and eventually so do we.</h2>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find myself spending more and more time thinking
      about inequality. I am incredibly privileged and grateful to be able to
      get to where I am, but I'm not so daft as to think that I got here with
      hard work or luck alone. I was able to get to where I was due to being in
      the right place at the right time. Being born into the family I was born
      into. Going to school where I did and making the friends I made. How we
      are raised has a big impact on who we are today. What values are instilled
      into us and what we believe is important in our lives. We are who we are
      because of the people around us, our experiences, and our ideals. We do
      not start life as a blank canvas of infinite possibilities, we start life
      as an mishmash of colors and ideas and we paint over it with the choices
      we make. Over time, I've started thinking more about inequality and just
      how unfair the world is.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all have some amount of time in our lives, some
      have more and some less. The amount of time we have is intrinsically
      unequal. This inequality is partially due to our choices, but it seems
      like it's mostly due to circumstances outside our control. We can be born
      into poverity or excess. I'm not trying to be fatalistic and saying that
      social mobility doesn't exist or that our choices don't matter. I wouldn't
      go as far as to say that, but I will claim that it is becoming harder and
      harder to move up in the world. The wealth gap keeps increasing and the
      dollar keeps getting devalued which creates an unequal impact between the
      rich and the poor. Like losing out on 10% of a paycheck might be the
      difference between food on the table or not, while losing 10% of a lot of
      money is still a lot of money.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember back in middle school, my dad used to
      buy chicken teriyaki at a local teriyaki place for $3.99 a plate. A few
      years later, the price increased to $4.99. Now the same teriyaki place
      sells the same teriyaki for ~$12.49 after tax and tip. It's about 3x the
      cost for the same teriyaki. I don't blame the business owners because they
      don't control inflation. They choose the price they believe their product
      is worth and it's not like they're trying to get rich making chicken
      teriyaki. They just want to make a living and serve good, affordable food.
      It is the same chicken teriyaki I had as a kid, but the price was ravaged
      by years of inflation. It makes me feel like one of those old people that
      were like, "Back in the day, I could buy a bottle of coke for a nickel!"
      and I guess I have a taste of how it feels now.

    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another example of this is how my dad says that
      back when he was in college, he would be able to afford an entire year of
      tuition by working over the summer. Apparently it wasn't that crazy of a
      thing and it's not because he had a fancy tech job or worked at a large
      business, he paid for this year of tuition by working as a waiter at a
      restaurant. Because tuition wasn't as high back in the day. Nowadays,
      people pay for tuition with the help of their parents, student loans, or
      if they're lucky and in an engineering field/business, summer internships.
      It's possible that the quality of education changed, but I don't think
      it's changed so much that it justifies the price increase. At the
      University of Washington, the cost of tuition right now for a quarter
      (2021-2022) is around
      <a
        href="https://www.washington.edu/opb/tuition-fees/current-tuition-and-fees-dashboards/detailed-tuition-dashboard/"
        >$4,026</a
      >
      for in-state students and back in 1971, it was around
      <a
        href="https://www.washington.edu/students/gencat/archive/GenCat1972-74v1.pdf#page=24"
        >$165</a
      >
      a quarter for in-state students. Adjusted for inflation, this would be
      around
      <a href="https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm">$1,198.57</a>.
      This is around a x4 increase, which is kind of insane since I don't think
      the quality of education has improved by x4.

    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fight for a $15 minimum wage started in 2012
      and it's still not really a thing. Minimum wage back in 1970 was around
      <a
        href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/minimum-wage/history#:~:text=The%20minimum%20wage%20went%20to,farm%20workers%20stopped%20at%20%241.30."
        >$1.45</a
      >. Adjusted for inflation, this would be around $11.09. The federal
      minimum wage is currently
      <a
        href="https://ogletree.com/insights/minimum-wage-increases-in-2022-a-chart-of-upcoming-changes-and-interactive-map/#:~:text=In%202022%2C%20while%20the%20federal,minimum%20wage%20rates%20will%20increase."
        >$7.25</a
      >
      per hour. One dollar back then is worth $7.65 today. Median rent in 1970
      was
      <a href="https://ipropertymanagement.com/research/average-rent-by-year"
        >$108</a
      >, which adjusted for inflation is around $810.73 today, but the median
      rent back in 2020 was $1,104. Median rent has increased by almost 50% and
      the minimum wage has decreased by 35%, so it's not exactly a surprise to
      learn that people are hurting and unable to survive in today's
      environment.

      back in 2019. It seems like labor practices in many places around the
      world are more favorable to workers than the United States. Many places in
      the world seem to more favorable to live in in general than the United
      States, with healthcare that isn't tied to employment and better
      transportation services, at perhaps the cost of reduced wages.

    <h2>I don't believe that we were born into this world to work.</h2>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We decide how we spend our time with the choices
      we make. We try to build good habits. Who we are and what we do seem to be
      a function of time, among many other things. It takes time to do things.
      It takes time to get better at doing things. It takes time to develop
      relationships. We spend time doing what we care about and if we don't find
      the time to do something, maybe we just didn't care about it enough to
      find the time. Or maybe we actually have no time, which might be the case
      if we're just trying to survive in the world that functions by trading
      time we have for essential needs like housing, food, and health. Although
      I believe that anyone who works and contributes meaningfully to society
      should be able to afford housing and food without compromising their
      physical and mental well-being.

      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's been a couple of years. A lot of things have
      happened, yet lots of things haven't happened, and many more things have
      yet to happen. It's hard to imagine that we somehow got to where we are
      from where we were; but we're here, for better or worse.
