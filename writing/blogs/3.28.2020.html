  <h2>It's currently 4:16 AM.</h2>
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I decided that I'll start a blog because reflection is good and I guess maybe it'll be a good
    thing for me in the long-run; documenting how I'm doing over time and I can reflect on that later. It's like reflecting on
    reflections; which sounds kind of weird, but I guess we're a bit beyond that at this point. I'll pretty much just write
    the first thing that comes to my mind, so maybe a lot of this will be gibberish. Who knows? I guess I do, but that's besides
    the point. I should've started this a while back. I won't write something every day, but I'll probably write something when 
    I feel like it. 
  </p>
  <p>
    I guess a lot of stuff has happened in my life. Although one could argue that the same amount of things happen to everyone
    within any duration of time, which I accept as a valid argument. 
    I graduated last spring and a lot of my friends went on to jobs in industry. Some also went to
    grad school, which is pretty cool. I should probably try to stay connected with people more, but for some reason, I always
    justify not doing it by saying that I'm busy or something, which is something I should probably work on in the future.

  <h2>Summer</h2>
  <p>
    So during the summer, I went back to Taiwan to do an internship at my dad's friend's start-up. 
    It was in Taiwan because I got rejected/ghosted by all the internships I applied for earlier in the year, didn't have any
    references and I procrastinated on a project that a startup wanted me to do as part of their interview process.
    I think I would've been able to finish if I just put time into it, but I guess one of my weaknesses is finding 
    time for things that I didn't consider to be a priority in terms of what I needed to get done. It had to deal with working with
    technologies that I'd never worked with before, which usually involves me reading documentation and I didn't find time to do that;
    which is not super great because I guess all projects are like that. For the interviews that I failed, it was the first 
    interviewing season I went through, so I wasn't sure what people looked for and I didn't have any white-boarding experience.
  </p>
  <p> 
    There were also times when some interviewer said I was doing something was wrong, but I'm pretty sure I wasn't. I spent
    way too long on some earlier section of the interview, so instead of taking the time and talking through the logic of why 
    it's actually fine, I got defensive and became flustered, then everything went downhill from there. 
    I guess that's life though and it's definitely a learning experience. 
  </p>
  <img src="./imgs/3.28.2020/boba.jpg" style="width:50%; height: auto;">
  <p>
    Anyways, back to the summer. It was the first time that I went back to Taiwan in about 10 years and my mom's side of the family lives
    in Taiwan, so it's been a while. 
    If you know me, you'll probably know that my Mandarin isn't very great, but I understand enough of it to follow most conversations. 
    I also avoid speaking Mandarin because of self-consicousness issues, but I should probably just get over it. 
    Anyways, I hung out with them during gatherings and they were all pretty chill. I appreciate that my mom dragged me outside to
    do things with her even though at the time I just wanted to stay home and work on projects or something. I met some people that were
    pretty cool and got some boba. My mom ended up dragging me to a lot of dinners with her friends and she says she didn't have a lot
    of friends, but she actually did.
  </p>
  <p>
    Then during the internship, I worked on developing some backend stuff for monitoring website/service health, since their company
    was sort of based on alerting customers when their websites/services were down and I learned stuff about kafka and elasticsearch.
    They were all pretty chill and their English was actually really good, even though they pretty much didn't use English except around me.
    They had team meetings in Mandarin though, which I generally understood. There was something really janky with their wifi though and I 
    got disconnected every few minutes. There was also a point in time when I tried pinging Google from some server based in China to test something I wrote before remembering that Google is blocked in China. Everyone was cool and it was interesting working on a team with 
    people that had varied backgrounds.  
  </p>
  <p>
    They also wanted to do some things with machine learning, but I don't think the things that they
    had set up was conducive for that. They wanted to predict/recognize when there were outages/crashes instead of just spikes, but the 
    only information that they had for that was the actual measurements and nothing additional like user usage patterns or user statistics. 
    Although I guess the some parts of ML and big data is recording a lot of things and then doing some sort of classification/regression,
    so a lot of information is needed. Anyways, I set up some rtmp monitoring service, set up my own Zookeeper+Kafka+Elasticsearch 
    setup and some HTTP end-points for some Linux networking tools/functions. As a sidenote, Taiwan got some things right, like bubble
    tea was around two USD and lunches were around 3-4 USD; although the cost of living and minimum wage is less, so I guess my views
    on the prices are a bit biased.

  <h2>Grad school</h2>
  <p>
    Then when I got back, I started grad school. It was just a masters as a part of a combined bs/ms program though. 
    It's sort of like undergrad. Not much has changed, but a lot of my friends graduated and now I sort of just hang out with 
    people who were also part of the bs/ms program and a few undergrads. I started actually preparing for interviews properly with
    some friends and did some leetcode. I guess I should get back into it eventually; but my interviews worked out a bit better. 
    I'll be interning at Amazon over the summer, assuming it doesn't get cancelled over the COVID-19 mess. A lot of companies still
    ghosted me and I guess it's the resume, since it looks rather plain. Some friends recommended adding some colors or something and
    changing the font from Consolas to something else; but now it's even plainer, so I think I need to fix it somehow.
  </p>
  <img src="./imgs/3.28.2020/dell_roof.jpg" style="width:50%; height: auto;">
  <p> 
    I spent some time with friends and grabbed some food with friends/visited friends and went to grab some food with them. I still
    need to finish my Paxos Visualization project. Although there was a group that did it for their Data Visualization project, I still
    want to do it myself. I worked on some projects with friends and some other friends graduated. There were too many papers to read and 
    math is still hard @_@, but I guess that's also just life.
  </p>
  <img src="./imgs/3.28.2020/dl_worth.jpg" style="width:50%; height: auto;">
  <p> 
    I worked on some distributed Machine Learning thing for live 
    inference/training, some adversarial deep learning testing thing, and then did a paper survey on federated learning. 
    I still think that everything in CS is just math, so there's that. I also TAed a machine learning class in Fall, which was pretty fun. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Then during the winter, I hung out with some friends that graduated and we're trying to do a weekly thing where we meet up and grab some
    food in Seattle, but bingo and COVID happened, so we're postponing that until when the stay-at-home order is lifted. I TAed 
    Distributed Systems and I'm proud to say that I had 20 people come to my office hours at some point during the quarter; so that was 
    exciting in terms of being a TA, since I think the most I had office hours before then was 13. I worked on a solo educational project and
    tried to make a wide FOV VR headset with a friend, but 3D printing didn't work out very well and we ended up just going with cardboard. 
    I went to two concerts. One was American Authors with PUBLIC and MAGIC GIANT, which was fun. 
    I also saw a friend at the concert. Deep Water by American Authors is a pretty good song. 
    Then the other was from This Will Destroy You and it was definitely sound. I liked it, but it was more like music I would like
    to listen to by myself because I guess it was good for thinking. To be honest, I'd describe prog-rock as thinking music. Anyways, the 
    quarter ended with COVID-19 things happening and take-home finals. The take-home finals were hard and I'm not sure if I understood
    anything by the end. This was also when I started using UberEats, since I guess my reasoning was like, "I guess I'll pay 7 dollars to 
    save on the hour I'd spend going outside to grab food." 
  </p>
  <p>
    Then we're here. I started doing research in the last week or so of Winter quarter, but I can't really call it research because 
    I haven't done much yet. Currently I'm working on doing some benchmarking of operations in RocksDB, but that isn't too much. I'm also
    sort of procrastinating on that, but I want to enjoy my spring break. I'm thinking of redoing my resume in LaTeX eventually. I'm going
    to TA Distributed Systems again, which will be interesting. A lot of universities are moving online, so everything's basically Zoom 
    University next quarter. Zoom is basically what Skype could've been; but never was, which is interesting to think about technology-wise. 
    You could say that UW will be competiting against other online universities like the University of Phoenix.  
  </p>

  <p>
    Lastly, I think I spend too much time on cs things and probably too much time with cs people. I don't think it's very good when 
    your comedic sense or idea of what is "funny" is directly tied to your field of study, but I guess that's my life at this point.
