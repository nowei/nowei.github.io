    <h1>10/1/2023: On Time and Moving On</h1>
    <hr />
    <h2>It's 1:12 AM.</h2>
    <p>
      I woke up yesterday to my dad asking me if I wanted to go with him on a
      hike, but I was too tired from staying up to play games with some friends.
      The good, healthy thing probably would've been to join him anyways,
      regardless of how tired I was. I'm tired every day and I have to do things
      every day anyways, so why shouldn't I go? I went back to sleep, telling
      him that I'd go next week. But what will change about next week? Will I
      not feel tired on a Saturday morning? It's hard to say, but how many times
      can we kick things to the next week before there is no next week?
    </p>
    <p>Eventually time catches up to us and there is no more next time.</p>
    <p>
      An aside: Maybe part of the problem is that I'm tired every day. But even
      if I'm tired, I still have to do things. I still wake up to volunteer
      (albeit consistently a bit late). I still wake up to work or go to work. I
      still wake up to greet the day, day after day. Maybe I avoid waking up
      because I subconsciously associate waking up with the expectations and
      responsibilities of living in a society. Although I'm probably not the
      only one who avoids waking up because revenge bedtime procrastination is a
      thing. I'd probably be a lot less tired if I just slept earlier or
      exercised regularly. Although it's hard to live for the future when the
      present seems so bleak. Maybe the world is getting better, but it seems
      like every step forward is hard-fought and suffers the risk of getting set
      back multiple steps. How do we effect change in a society that is scared
      of the future? Shirking away from all the possibilities for the future
      because some outcomes may be bad? Have we become so pessimistic that we
      are driven to inaction for fear of what action could bring? We probably
      maintain the status quo because that is what is easy, not because it is
      what is right.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is always fun meeting up with people, friends, and acquaintances.
      Although when it gets to the time to go, there is always a certain
      bittersweet feeling. I pretty much always say something along the lines
      of, "until next time," as a goodbye since there are no good goodbyes. Then
      we may not talk for days, days that turn into weeks, weeks that turn into
      months, and then months that turn into years. There may not actually be a
      next time, who knows what'll happen in the future? Like friends or
      coworkers who say that you should stay in touch and you just don't. It's
      not like you actually dislike the other person in any sense of the word or
      that you don't actually want to stay in touch, but life gets in the way.
      We live our lives from moment to moment. Then we look back, thinking where
      the time went. At times it feels like time is ephemeral, and at other
      times it may feel agonizingly long. There is no time. Yet we have all the
      time in the world (or at least the time granted to us by the genetic
      lottery, luck, and maybe some margin of error (read: wiggle room) based on
      some measure of self-care).
    </p>
    <p>
      In the universe of people, this probably isn't an uncommon occurrence.
      There is nothing fundamentally wrong with this because every person is
      their own, with their own thoughts and living their own lives with
      autonomy or at least however much autonomy is granted to them in the
      system we exist and participate in. (Because in reality we are only living
      our lives in a fashion that is begrudgingly accepted by the oppressors,
      with every comfort and right granted to us through collective action. Also
      note that rights and opportunities for some groups is still unequal
      because some things about society are fundamentally broken.) Relationships
      are a two-way street that requires both parties to maintain lest it falls
      into disrepair. We weave in and out of each others lives, so how do you
      make these interactions meaningful? Not pointless? How can we spend our
      time together such that it moves the metaphorical needle? The people we
      spend every day with may not always be around, so how can we derive
      meaning from our interactions?
    </p>
    <p>
      Everyone probably lives with some sort of existential angst, but maybe it
      is just more at the forefront for some than others. Or they distract
      themselves with life keeping busy such that they don't need to think about
      it? The sense of existential dread hanging at the back of everyone's mind.
      "What am I doing?" "Who am I?" "Am I enough? What does that even mean?"

      I got home from Seattle a few hours ago from a friend's going away party.
    </h2>
    <p>If they ever read this, however unlikely, "Hi! xD"</p>
    <p>
      It's not like they'll be gone forever or that I'd never see them again out
      in this vast world. Will things fundamentally change? Probably? I spent a
      lot of time with them in college (per aspera ad astra and whatnot) and saw
      them like once a week for the last couple of years and it was always nice
      or good to spend time with them. So this goodbye was especially
      bittersweet, but people must move on. They must move on to the next
      chapter of their lives, to tackle bigger, better things. There is
      generally no guarantee that things will always be better or that life will
      be good, as life will always have its mix of ups and downs. Sometimes all
      we can do is hope that nothing goes wrong in this system that is barely
      held together by duct tape and dreams.

      I'd never tell them this in person, but they're probably one of the best
      people I know. Not because they're particularly good at everything they do
      (which is also not to say that they aren't good at every thing they try),
      but because of how real they are. I've interacted with this person over
      the years, saw them obtain hobbies that came and went and came back again,
      worked with them and watched them learn new things; essentially change and
      grow as a person. People change all the time, but it's interesting to
      reflect on all the changes over time. In a few words, they are chaotic,
      strong-willed, and raw. They actively look for new experiences or excuses
      to try new things and dragged people along with her. They are someone that
      pushes people up and forward rather than beat them down.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has historically been unsaid and there have been many times when I have
      said a last farewell (sometimes unknowingly), but I hope that people know
      that even if I never see or speak to them again in the rest of our short
      lives, I am rooting for them. Come what may with expectation and ambition,
      wherever you are or whatever you're trying to accomplish, I am rooting for
      you. To be human and mortal is to struggle and burn like a star against
      the pitch-black void that just wants to extinguish all light and life.
    </p>
    <p>
      I guess times change, for better or worse (but hopefully for the better
      ðŸ™‚).
    </p>
    <p>May we meet in better times and better places. Until next time.</p>
