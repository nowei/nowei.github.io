      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm taking ibuprofen following a couple of wisdom
      tooth extractions. Apparently I only had two wisdom teeth
      (#BuiltDifferent), so in a sense I guess I've won something from the
      genetic lottery. It's kind of weird that we even have wisdom teeth, but
      from what I recall (and because I'm too lazy to cite my sources at this
      point in the night), it's an evolutionary thing from when we used to eat
      more meat and chew our food more. We also chew less due to improved food
      processing techniques, which also led to more crooked teeth among certain
      populations over time. I guess Mastication is important. Anyways, the
      operation wasn't too bad besides not being able to eat for like 8 hours
      before the operation and ~the day after if you get too lazy to prepare any
      soft foods to eat. I hear that everyone heals at a different rate, so your
      milage may vary. It's a little unfortunate that I did this during a break
      since I really want to eat solid food, but I guess it's better to do it
      sooner than later to avoid potential complications down the road. I had my
      biannual dentist cleaning like a week and a half ago and managed to book
      the consultation and operation over the last week and a half due to other
      people canceling their appointments, so I guess I got lucky with
      scheduling.

      I just rewrote my resume in LaTeX because I don't have Microsoft Office on
      my new laptop and I don't really like the transition from a one-time fee
      for Office into a subscription. I also don't know enough people who use
      the Office ecosystem that it justfies buying a family plan and splitting
      costs (ðŸ‘€ @ Netflix). Sure, a lot of people use Windows laptops, but there
      are alternatives to the Microsoft ecosystem that people can use. I ended
      up pretty much just copy-pastaing the resume, but LaTeX is kinda wonky, so
      it took a while to port it over. There was a lot of badness that I'm
      willing to overlook. It's still two-column, which is supposedly bad for
      ATS systems, but I think most application portals are just kind of stupid.
      Like we're asked to put in all the information that we already have on our
      resume, then they also expect their system to parse the resume in a
      comprehensible manner. So at this point I kind of gave up on ATS parsing
      and expect people to actually read the resume. Like if we put in this much
      time into writing a resume and making it look okay, I kind of expect
      people to at least look at it. I didn't make many more edits this time
      around, but one thing I learned is that it's sometimes hard to measure how
      much impact one feature or some contribution actually makes on the system,
      especially if it's part of some UX improvement initiative.

      I was actually in Taiwan from like mid-November to early December. I went
      back to visit some family since it's been a while since I've went back due
      to COVID and travel restrictions, but really I mostly went back to eat
      food. My one regret was not taking this time off and thinking that it's
      tenable to work and volunteer remotely with the time difference. It was
      okay to work in Taiwan time, but that meant I couldn't really go out and
      do stuff/grab food during the day. In the future I'll probably just plan
      to take the time off if I'm traveling. I didn't really get to eat as much
      as I would've liked to, which seems to be a problem people have when they
      get older, but the food I did eat was good. It's crazy how much cheaper
      food is in Taiwan. The cost of living is generally lower, but people also
      make less money there, so you know, tradeoffs exist.

      During my sleep-addled transition to Taipei Standard Time, I felt like I
      had what was a quarter-life crisis (being generous ðŸ‘€). It made me rethink
      what I thought about friends, work, and life.

      On friendship.

    <p>
      What are friends? Are friends just people you talk to and hang out with?
      People you spend time with? In which case, when do people go from
      strangers, to acquaintances, to friends? Or when do people go from friends
      to acquaintances and back to strangers? I guess it's kind of hard to
      imagine that the people you interact with daily will change, but it almost
      always happens. Change is the natural state of things and I guess that's
      life. School was a target-rich environment for making friends, since there
      are always people around, but people come and go. Who you interact with
      and who you spend time with will change as you get older. This is true for
      almost everyone, minus like really tightly-knit small towns where no one
      ever moves out and people live to an old age. Although these communities
      are a little unfathomable to me in that there's this giant, diverse world
      out there and this small town is all they've known. It's not an invalid
      way to live, but definitely one of the more interesting situations in our
      hyperconnected society. I guess it's not really very rare if a large chunk
      of America lives in rural areas, at least by land mass. Maybe I'm a little
      pessimistic in that sense, since I feel like all relationships are
      situational and proximity-based and I feel like many friendships are
      doomed to end in neglect and decay until friends eventually become
      strangers. Common settings, interactions, and shared interests form the
      basis of relationships, but people and settings change over time. It's
      unlikely to meet someone who says that they haven't changed. Or they may
      deny it, but the change may have happened over time such that they don't
      recognize the small changes and don't even realize that they've changed
      significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      I guess one of the problems I have is with how I view(ed) friendships. I
      viewed friendships as ephemeral so I didn't see the point in maintaining
      friendships. Like what is the point of maintaining relationships with
      people who are eventually going to leave? Or we lie to ourselves and claim
      that we're busy and have no time for this or that, when in reality all we
      have is time. It's impossible to keep all your friends over time, but it's
      likely that not all friendships are meant to decay into becoming strangers
      again. We all have friends that reach out and maintain the friendships,
      either by being proactive or spontaneous. I hope I can be more like that
      in the future. Maybe the key is that when you think of someone or
      something, reach out? I guess an open question is how to foster
      relationships and friendships. It is probably the wrong question to ask
      which relationships are worth maintaining, as it's too calculating and
      cold. Who are we and what is important to us? How do we maintain interest
      in other people and stay relevant to others such that we are more than
      just fairweather friends? What does it mean to live an interesting life?
    </p>
    <p>On work.</p>
    <p>
      Is work just a means to an end? Work is not life. Although it is likely
      undeniable that work is an aspect of life. Can you be friends with the
      people that you work with? Probably, but at the end of the day, we're all
      there for a our own reasons. There are a few things that can unite people,
      like it could be a vision, a dream, or maybe just a paycheck. The last one
      likely doesn't apply if you're already well-off, in which case you're
      probably working to give yourself a sense of meaning or a sense that
      you're contributing something to society. Who knows? Work supposedly gives
      people purpose or it's at least supposed to give some sense of it. Or at
      least that's been espoused as one of the pillars of a functioning society.
      Although some may argue that functioning is a generous way to describe our
      society, while others may also argue that "functioning" is on a spectrum
      and many things can be better or worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      "So be grateful for what you have," is what I hear from a member of my
      family, which is a little hard to accept. Like the idea that people have
      it worse than you, so you should be grateful for what you have. It's
      pretty much the "starving kids in Africa" argument. Their situation is
      recognizably worse, but is it enough to shut down conversations about how
      to make our own situations better? Do people not deserve to have nice
      things? What is the value of labor? Why are some forms of labor worth more
      than others? Is it the prerequisite knowledge that makes up the
      difference? The initial investment of time and money? How could people who
      didn't have the privilege of investing so much time and money be able to
      catch up or compete? Are they supposed to just be denied the opportunity
      to pursue their passions? Sure, some of the difference can be explained by
      hard work, but there is also a privilege associated with being able to
      work hard, like the other things happening in your life do not distracting
      you from whatever you're pursuing. Like you didn't have to care for sick
      or elderly family members. Or you didn't have to take care of younger
      siblings or start working early. People who prevail through problematic
      situations are strong, not because of their situations, but in spite of
      it. We live in a fundamentally inequitable society and instead of
      recognizing it, some people balk at the idea that inequality even exists
      in our Great society. Some opportunities afforded to some are nothing more
      than dreams or fairy tales for others. We do not live in a fair society.
    </p>
    <p>
      The contributions some people make in a society are also a little
      nebulous. Like a construction worker may be able to see the building that
      they helped build, but for other things like research, it's a little
      harder to see what the outcomes will be. It's a skill to be able to
      project where you are to set a course for where you want to be and
      recognize where you'll probably be. Some of it is managing expectations
      and some may argue that it's partly based on experience, partly based on
      speculation, and partly based on faith. It's a little suspect in the case
      of technology, like what kind of contribution does an app or feature make?
      What is the impact that something will make in the future? Then sometimes
      people can claim that you don't see the vision but it's a little hard to
      perceive something as mysterious and uncertain as the future. We will not
      be where we are in a week, a month, a year. The answers to important
      questions like, "What are we doing? Why are we doing this? Should we be
      doing something else?" will also change over time. Some things that we
      think might be necessary one week may be deemed unnecessary the next week.
      Perfect is the enemy of good. It doesn't make sense to spend too much time
      architecting a perfect system if it is uncertain whether it will exist in
      a few weeks or a few months. There may still be something to be gained in
      working with and learning from hypotheticals, but it likely does very
      little good to be bogged down in certain situations. No one can tell what
      the future will hold, but they can make an informed decision based on what
      they know about the past and present. Nothing stays still, everything in
      life moves on. So be okay with change.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are what we do. We aren't only what we do, but if we spend a large
      amount of time during the week working, say ~40 of our waking hours, we
      are, in a sense, at least partly what we do. I'm not talking about us
      being the sum of our productivity, as that's a rather bleak way of viewing
      things and sees workers as nothing more than units of work. But I mean
      that what we do for our jobs and the nature of our work has an impact on
      our lives. It gets incorporated into how we think about everything around
      us, like our thought processes, habits, and ideas. There are many other
      things in life that also have a significant impact, but the things that we
      do are undeniably a part of our identity and at least a snapshot of our
      values. Which begs the question, is what you're doing what you want to be
      doing? Is this where you want to be? Is this who you want to be? If you
      want to change, what does change look like and what do you need to do?
    </p>
    <p>On life.</p>
    <p>
      I likely need to exercise more. It makes no sense to work your entire
      life. It also doesn't make sense for the purpose of work to be retirement.
      What are we here to do? Does what we do matter? What is the impact of our
      work? The purpose of life is also probably not to become economically or
      financially viable. What does it mean to have lived a life? People come in
      and out of each other's lives, sharing stories and experiences. We
      probably should not only start living life when we are old and retired. So
      how do we live a life worth living? Well, I'm not sure, but I believe that
      everyone should be able to live a life worth living, not just those that
      were lucky enough to achieve financial freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many things in life should not be tied to monetary amounts. Like the worth
      of a life, the cost of living, or the cost of healthcare. There will
      always be problems in society, but it seems more fruitful to start
      conversations off on matters that impact a lot of people rather than
      severely restrict the lives of a few. Like there are problems with
      universal healthcare and no system is perfect, but it seems like it's at
      least a better system than getting suffocated in a mountain of medical
      debt. Like a Woman's right to choose should not be brought into question
      by old men whose extent of knowledge on the female reproductive system is
      that it exists or that childbirth happens. It should be easy for people to
      vote on issues that matter to them. People and kids should not be going
      hungry, wanting mouths should be able to be fed; we live in excess for
      some and destitution for comparatively many. People deserve to be able to
      afford a place to live, a minimum wage should be a livable wage; not at
      the cost of working excessive hours or multiple jobs. Our agricultural
      industry heavily relies on migrant workers and the alienation of their
      needs, rights, or a path to citizenship has become a talking point.
      Consumerism goes hand in hand with anti-environmentalism and exploitation
      of the workers. I don't believe that people should own nothing, but many
      things can likely be made to be more sustainable so that we don't ruin the
      earth for generations to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      People deserve respect, our patience, and a chance. People talk about
      someone's personal responsibility to take care of themselves, but it is
      also our personal responsibility to help others in need. Some claim it is
      not the government that should help the people, but the people that should
      help the people. But are they? Do they? Will they? If not now, when?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Blessed are old people who plant trees knowing that they shall never sit
      in the shade of their foliage." It seems like many issues arise when the
      incentives are not aligned. Like why should people do something if it
      doesn't benefit them? Part of the problem is that our representatives are
      not always interested in the issues that matter to the people who need the
      representation the most. A rising tide lifts all boats; both big and
      small.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems like we have been walking towards preventable disasters one step
      at a time, thinking it to be inevitable. We throw our hands up and say
      that it's not up to us to decide, that it's not our problem because it
      doesn't directly impact us. What do we do for the future? What will our
      kids, our grandkids, and future generations remember of us? We may not be
      important enough to exist in the history books, but the stories of our
      lives may be passed down. What actions can we take to make a lasting,
      positive impact for the future? How do we make life better for ourselves
      and others?

    <h2>It's 10:40 PM.</h2>
    <p>
      I started this a few months ago and never found the motivation (read time
      to reflect on things) to finish it. Many things happened and many things
      didn't happen. Which is to say, as I have often said: life goes on,
      whether you want it to or not. I think something I could work on is to not
      work as hard. Like back in school and while I was growing up, I was taught
      that I should work hard if I want to suceed. I interpreted that as
      academic success and probably missed out on some things, but there's more
      to life than just academics. When I was volunteering, I thought of it as
      the number of people I helped or the number of tasks completed or the
      number of hours spent. Then when I started working, I interpreted it as
      the amount of work I got done, so the number of bugs I fixed and the
      number of features I implemented.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's a little stressful to work at a startup sometimes. Like it seems like
      we are always on crunch time and that everything is on fire. I felt some
      pressure from the uncertainty of it all. Maybe that is just the nature of
      working at a startup? How do you make an impact? How do you make a product
      that is marketable? How do you attract and retain customers? It can't just
      be something slick. It usually needs to have some bones to prop up the
      design. A friend told me that I don't get paid enough to worry as much as
      I do and they're probably correct. Although it's probably the case that no
      one gets paid enough to worry as much as they do. Or if they are, I'd be
      interested to hear a number ðŸ‘€. I'm also uncertain about whether my use of
      emojis is tied to the amount of underlying stress I'm feeling or if it's
      just something I picked up from work. Like using the ðŸ‘€ emoji to mean I'm
      taking a look or that something is sus. And using like ðŸ˜Ž to mean that
      something is good or fine.
    </p>
    <p>
      We all try to do our best with who we are, where we're at, and what we
      have. "If you're tired and you're feeling around a 40% and you gave 40%
      that day, you gave your 100% that day and should know that you did your
      best." - idk who said this, but it's good to quote things so you don't
      pass off knowledge as your own when it isn't. Proper attribution is
      important :^)
    </p>
    <p>
      Some people say that some stress is good for you, in similar terms to how
      eating some spicy food could be good for you. The problem is that while
      spicy food is generally avoidable, stress is a little harder to avoid. It
      might not be too much of a stretch to say that I've never felt fully
      relaxed in my life. There was always a feeling that there was something
      that I had to do, either right now or at some point in the future. Or like
      I was always waiting for some other shoe to drop, so I had to be prepared
      for when it did. I don't think I grew up with good coping mechanisms for
      stress. I think I alleviated stress by getting things done. Which, while
      productive, isn't very relaxing and does not go very far in terms of
      coming to terms with stressful situations. Getting things done mitigates
      some of the cause for the stress, but it does very little for your mental
      well-being or your ability to handle stress in your life. If your only
      mechanism for coping with stress is to work, but working is a cause of
      stress, you end up in a cycle of stress where you're very productive at
      the cost of your mental and physical well-being. (Or maybe it's my coping
      mechanism for a lack of control in my life. Like I cannot do anything
      about issues that exist so I put my efforts into something I can impact.)
      This is fundamentally unsustainable. It is like burning a candle on both
      ends. (Although in the metaphor, burning a single end of a candle was
      already problematic. Why should we permanently lose some of ourselves in
      order to get something done?) On the bright side, I found that yoga has
      been helpful with this. Since the point of the practice is to live in the
      moment, to push past and future stressors off and to focus on the here and
      now. Although this could also be the result of making time to focus on
      something other than work.
    </p>
    <p>
      I guess that's where my life is at. We will see what changes in a few
      months.
