  <h1>Imposter syndrome</h1>
  <h2 style="display:inline">
    Imposter syndrome is the feeling of being an imposter.</h2>
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's when you feel like you aren't good enough to be where you are or that someday, 
    someone will realize that you don't belong there. A lot of people have imposter syndrome, but it's prevalent 
    in STEM-related fields. 
  </p>
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It might manifest itself in many ways, you might feel (maybe <i>know</i>) that people
    around you are better than you and that they have their lives in order; while you're just trying to figure out 
    what you want to do with your life. It might feel like everyone around you is successful and that they're more 
    hard-working, talented, or smarter than you are. It might make you feel small, standing among these giants. 
  </p>
  <p> 
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They might feel the same way. 
  </p>
  <h2>"I wish I was smart/talented/had a better work ethic."</h2>
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one is born knowing how to walk. (Well, with the exception of migratory animals like
    giraffes.) We start our lives with little to no knowledge and we spend the rest of our lives learning things.
  </p>
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one is born with an underlying knowledge of how the world works. We learn all these 
    things from our interactions with other people and from our own observations. Similarly, no one is born knowing 
    Java or Python, how to talk, how to do maths, cook, etc. We learn these things by putting time and effort into 
    it. 
  </p>
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The internet has become a great equalizer for access to resources that can help you 
    learn what you want to learn. (Inequalities still exist, but I'll touch upon those at another time.) We can 
    only learn something if we spend time learning it and we can only improve at something if we spend time doing 
    it. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Everyone who has learned something started somewhere, but everyone who has learned it has started. No one
    can expect to become a chess grandmaster without ever playing a game. The same goes for whatever you're trying
    to do. 
  </p>
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's never a good idea to 
    <!--  Whether you 
    like something or not is up to you. You can also say that these preferences stem from previous experiences and
    that they're justified.
    you have no motivation to do something, but  -->

  </p>
  <h2>No one is infallible, people will make mistakes.</h2>
  <p>
    We might compare ourselves to people who look like they never failed at anything in their lives. 
  </p>
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People who are smart might feel like they aren't smart. People who can sing might think 
    that they sound like trash. People who can draw might think that their drawings look terrible. There are times 
    in our lives when we feel like we aren't doing enough, that we're not good enough, or that we aren't... enough.
  </p>
  <h2>At the end of the day, all we can do is try our best and hope that it was enough.</h2>
