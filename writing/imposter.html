    <h2>Imposter syndrome is the feeling of being an imposter.</h2>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's when you feel like you aren't good enough to
      be where you are or that someday, someone will realize that you don't
      belong there. A lot of people have imposter syndrome. It's generally
      prevalent in STEM-related fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It might manifest itself in many ways, you might
      feel (maybe <i>know</i>) that people around you are better than you and
      that they have their lives in order; while you're just trying to figure
      out what you want to do with your life. It might feel like everyone around
      you is successful and that they're more hard-working, talented, or smarter
      than you are. It might make you feel small, standing among these giants.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They might feel the same way.</p>

        >tl;dr: It takes time to learn things. The first step is to start and
        the next is to keep it up.</i

    </h3>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one is born knowing how to walk. (Well, with
      the exception of migratory animals like giraffes.) We start our lives with
      little to no knowledge and we spend the rest of our lives learning things.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one is born with an underlying knowledge of how
      the world works. We learn all these things from our interactions with
      other people and from our own observations. Similarly, no one is born
      knowing how to program, talk, do maths, cook, etc... We learn these things
      by putting our time and effort into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The internet has become a great equalizer for
      access to resources that can help you learn what you want to learn.
      (Inequalities still exist, but that's a conversation for a different day.)
      We can only learn something if we spend time learning it. Likewise, we can
      only improve at something if we spend time doing it. It might be easier
      for some people to learn some things because of their experiences or their
      background or because it clicks with them, but that came from spending
      time in the past learning something that helped them in the present.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first step to learning how to do something is
      to start. Everyone who knows how to do something started at some point in
      their lives. No one can expect to become a chess grandmaster without ever
      playing a game. The same probably goes for whatever you're trying to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work ethic is something that you develop over
      time, after you acknowledge your good and bad habits. It's a workflow
      unique to yourself. You have to figure out what works for you and think
      about why it works. Like when you need to take a break. Few people can
      just continuously work and not take breaks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motivation is fickle and fleeting, so it's
      important to learn how to form good habits. Bad habits are hard to break
      because they always tend to be easier to form, while good habits are hard
      to form and hard to keep.
    </p>

    <h2>No one is infallible, it's okay make mistakes.</h2>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People who do something amazingly well might think
      that they're terrible at it; since they compare themselves to people who
      they believe are better at that it somehow. There are times in our lives
      when we feel like we aren't doing enough, that we're not good enough, or
      that we aren't... enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can't hold ourselves to impossible standards.
      We can't expect everything we do to be perfect. Even if we could do things
      perfectly for a while, there will be a time when we eventually stumble and
      fall. Learning how to deal with failure is to learn how to get back up and
      keep going. It's learning how to move forward with our lives and not get
      dragged down by the mistakes we made in the past.
    </p>

    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think about all the things you've done and all the
      people you met, all your experiences. Even if you could've done more, been
      better; would you really want to go back and change everything if you
      could? Your past plays a role in shaping you into who you are today; but
      that doesn't mean it defines who you are, who you'll become, or what
      you're going to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm friends with a lot of people I would consider
      to be successful. They might not think so themselves, but that's what I
      think of them. It might take some time for them to realize it themselves,
      through the lens of their own perspective. The same goes for me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of us deal with imposter syndrome every day.
      I feel like I'm not good enough, that I don't actually know what I'm
      doing, or that I don't actually know anything and everything is feigned,
      faked. Even though people tell me that I'm doing fine, being told that and
      actually feeling it are drastically different. I feel like I don't know
      what I'm doing with my life or what I want to do with my life. People tell
      me that I'm young, that I have time to figure this out; but time forever
      moves forward and at one point, there will be no time left.
    </p>
    <p>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess the only way to dispel this feeling is to
      go out there and prove to yourself that you're actually doing alright,
      whatever that means.
