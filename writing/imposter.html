  <h1>Imposter syndrome</h1>
  <h2 style="display:inline">
    Imposter syndrome is the feeling of being an imposter.</h2>
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's when you feel like you aren't good enough to be where you are or that someday, 
    someone will realize that you don't belong there. A lot of people have imposter syndrome, but it's especially 
    prevalent in STEM-related fields. 
  </p>
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It might manifest itself in many ways, you might feel (maybe <i>know</i>) that people
    around you are better than you and that they have their lives in order; while you're just trying to figure out 
    what you want to do with your life. It might feel like everyone around you is successful and that they're more 
    hard-working, talented, or smarter than you are. It might make you feel small, standing among these giants. 
  </p>
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If so, you're not alone. We all know people who we perceive as tremendously successful,
    like they have everything figured out. It's possible that they feel the same way, like they aren't doing enough 
    or that they don't know what they're going to do with their lives.
  </p>
  <h2>"I wish I was that smart/that talented/had that work ethic."</h2>
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If so, you're not alone. We all know people who we perceive as tremendously successful 
    and like they have everything figured out. Even so, it's possible that they feel the same way, like they don't
    know what they're going to do with their lives or even what they're doing right now.
  </p>
  <h2>At the end of the day, all we can do is try our best and hope that it was enough.</h2>
