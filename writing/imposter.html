  <h2 >Imposter syndrome is the feeling of being an imposter.</h2>
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's when you feel like you aren't good enough to be where you are or that someday, 
    someone will realize that you don't belong there. A lot of people have imposter syndrome, but it's prevalent 
    in STEM-related fields. 
  </p>
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It might manifest itself in many ways, you might feel (maybe <i>know</i>) that people
    around you are better than you and that they have their lives in order; while you're just trying to figure out 
    what you want to do with your life. It might feel like everyone around you is successful and that they're more 
    hard-working, talented, or smarter than you are. It might make you feel small, standing among these giants. 
  </p>
  <p> 
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They might feel the same way.

  <h2>"I wish I was (smarter|more talented|had a better work ethic)."</h2>
  <h3><i>tl;dr: It takes time to learn things. The first step is to start and the next is to keep it up.</i></h3>
  <h3>smarter</h3>
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one is born knowing how to walk. (Well, with the exception of migratory animals like
    giraffes.) We start our lives with little to no knowledge and we spend the rest of our lives learning things.
  </p>
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one is born with an underlying knowledge of how the world works. We learn all these 
    things from our interactions with other people and from our own observations. Similarly, no one is born knowing 
    Java or Python, how to talk, how to do maths, cook, etc... We learn these things by putting our time and effort 
    into it. 
  </p>
  <h3>more talented</h3>
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The internet has become a great equalizer for access to resources that can help you 
    learn what you want to learn. (Inequalities still exist, but I'll touch upon those at another time.) We can 
    only learn something if we spend time learning it and we can only improve at something if we spend time doing 
    it. It might be easier for some people to learn some things because of their experiences or their background, 
    because it clicks with them, but that came from spending time in the past learning something that helped 
    them in the present.
  </p>
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first step to learning how to do something is to start. Everyone who knows how 
    to do something started at some point in their lives. No one can expect to become a chess grandmaster without 
    ever playing a game. The same probably goes for whatever you're trying to do. 
  </p>
  <h3>better work ethic</h3>
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work ethic is something that you develop over time, after you acknowledge your good 
    and bad habits. It's a workflow unique to yourself. You have to figure out what works for you and think about
    why it works. Like when you need to take a break. Few people can just continuously work and not take breaks.
  </p>
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motivation is fickle and fleeting, so it's important to learn how to form good habits. 
    Bad habits are hard to break because they always tend to be easier to form, while good habits are hard to form 
    and hard to keep. 
  </p>

  <h2>No one is infallible, it's okay make mistakes.</h2>
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People who are smart might feel like they aren't smart. People who can sing might think 
    that they sound like trash. People who can draw might think that their drawings look terrible. There are times 
    in our lives when we feel like we aren't doing enough, that we're not good enough, or that we aren't... enough.
  </p>
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We can't hold ourselves to impossible standards. We can't expect everything we do to 
    be perfect. Even if we could do things perfectly for a while, there will be a time when will we eventually 
    stumble and fall. Learning how to deal with failure is to learn how to get back up and keep going. It's learning 
    how to move forward with our lives and not get dragged down by the mistakes we made in the past. 
  </p>

  <h2>Personal experience</h2>
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Think about all the things you've done and all the people you met, all your experiences. 
    Even if you could've done more, been better; would you really want to go back and change everything if you could?
    Your past plays a role in shaping you into who you are today, but that doesn't mean it defines who you are, who
    you'll become, or what you're going to do. 
  </p>
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm friends with a lot of people I would consider to be successful. They might not 
    think so about themselves, but that's what I think of them. It might take some time for them to realize it 
    themselves, through the lens of their own perspective. The same goes for me.
  </p>
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I deal with imposter syndrome every day. I feel like I'm not good enough, that I don't actually 
    know what I'm doing, or that I don't actually know anything and everything is feigned, faked. Even though people 
    tell me that I'm doing fine, being told that and actually feeling it are drastically different. I feel like I 
    don't know what I'm doing with my life or what I want to do with my life. People tell me that I'm young, that I 
    have time to figure this out; but time moves forever forward and at one point, there will be no time left.
  </p>
  <p>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess the only way to dispel this feeling is to prove to myself that I'm actually doing 
    alright, that I can fail and pick myself back up. 
  </p>
